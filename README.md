## Overview  

React/NextJS web applications handle things differently than web apps of the past. But that doesan’t mean they still can’t look good.

It’s time to add some style to our components.

## Feature Tasks and Requirements  

- [] Modify your existing NextJS client app to style it with Sass.
- [] The style you add can be “hand rolled” without the use of additional styling libraries. But you can also leverage other tools if you like.
- [] Go live.

## Implementation Notes:  
- [] You won’t be graded on how “good” it looks, but on your use of Sass thoughout the app.
  - In other words, you want to add color to your app, the exact colors you choose is up to you.
  - But do your best to have it look good.

## User Acceptance Tests  

- [] No automated tests. But application must be deployed.
